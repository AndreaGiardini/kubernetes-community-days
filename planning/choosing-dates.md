# Choosing your KCD event date
When considering event dates for your KCD, there are many facotrs.

### Number 1 being the venue availability
Dependent on the country, some venues can easily book out 2 years in advance. Reminder: You may not announce your KCD until your contract with a venue is signed.

### Number 2 being when other KCDs in your region
If you are in a large country, we now require that each KCD within the same country, should happening no closer than 2 months apart.
If you are in Europe for example, and it is an easy trek to get to another KCD by traing (for example), or Asia Pacific and it is up to a 3-hour flight, then thesame standards apply.

### Number 3 being competitive events
Please utilize your organizer networks to explore surrounding events that may be happening at the same time, or within two-month's time. CNCF is only responsible for guiding you around other KCDs and CNCF & Linux Foundation-hosted events.

### Number 4 being holidays
Always consider not only your current country's holidays, but regional holidays that might affect speakers traveling to your KCD event.

### Number 5 being the work week
This is based on your culture and typical attendance:
* Is it typical of your culture to work lightly on Fridays?
* Is it typically of your culture to only be able to attend events on weekends?
* Is it acceptable for your culture to attend events during the week if it will help their current job? If so, consider a day where it might be a standard to not have meetings.
For example, some companies in the US have a "White Space Wednesday", meaning you can see the white space on your calendar because there are no meetings that day.
* Also, what is traditionally acceptable in terms of number of days during a week an employee can attend an event?
