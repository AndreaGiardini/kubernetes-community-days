# KCD Logo Use

Starting in 2024, all KCDs must have unity with the new logo (created in 2023).

There is flexibility in the logo background which can either be a flag or cityscape. [See examples here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jU_DkKTVUzimvhUfBqw8ZHfgZShov0Md/view?usp=drive_link) and work with Audra Montenegro to submit your request with the Linux Foundation Creative team.

The city must be respresented in the naming convention of your KCD with the following in mind. Please work with Audra for any exceptions.
* The size of the country you reside in
* The distance traveled to a KCD within the same country
